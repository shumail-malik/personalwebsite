          Hello! My name is Shumail Malik. <br>
          I am currently an undergraduate student at the <a href="https://www.math.iitb.ac.in/"> Department of Mathematics, IIT Bombay. </a><br>
          Here is a list of some things I find interesting.
          <br><br>
          At JNV, one of the coolest experiences was the migration program, like a Semester Exchange within India, where I got to spend 9th grade in Jammu & Kashmir. It was an incredible way to dive into different cultures and really opened my eyes to how beautifully diverse our country is!
          <br><br>
          I've been involved in various entrepreneurial ventures, including co-founding Gloria Coffee - a 20min Coffee delivery startup for Indian campuses. Later, I worked on Sponsify AI, a marketplace for brands and influencers for brand deals - we got an initial grant from <a href="https://www.dsse.iitb.ac.in/mentoring">IDEAS program</a>. Recently, I've been diving into personal projects using no-code and low-code tools—so much fun to see ideas come alive without coding every line from scratch!
          <br><br>
          I’m all about spotting little everyday problems and turning them into valuable, impactful products. My goal? To build things that help startups grow and make life just a little better for the people who use them!
